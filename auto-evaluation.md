## Good Development Practices
### About documents:
We wrote all our documentation in markdown.
### About git:
We commit only source and configuration files,we use a `.gitignores` file and all our commits are describing the changes and the reason for these changes and they are in english.
### About the code:
Our code is in english,the code is well indent and we did't mix the space and tabs also we test our software for several time using diffrent machines and we provide a  documentation to know how to use, compile, test and start the project,
