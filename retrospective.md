# Retrospective

## Difficulties:
* Working with binary was hard.
* Managing to handle the threading
* Managing the work between the member of the group "members from different Master's degree"

## Lessons:
This project taught us several things:
* How to implement a peer to peer protocole .
* The usage of TCP socket



## Good things to keep:
We managed to manage our time and share the tasks between us, we are proud of our team work and the work we have done.

## Bad things to avoid:
We would have liked to spend more time for this project to present a more appropriate work, but unfortunately we have other projects in parallel and we had to share our time between them, the problem of time we then penalize a little.
